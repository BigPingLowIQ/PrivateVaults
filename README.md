# PrivateVaults

## About me

Hello, I go by the name BigPingLowIQ. I am new to the programming scene and in a week of researching and learning how to make spigot plugins I came up with 
this simple but usefull plugin. 


## Description

This is an open source minecraft spigot plugin for creating private vaults. Each vault has a custom command name, title, size and permission. 
Simple to use and add new vaults using a couple commands.

## Usage

| Command | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `/open <vault_name>` | `Open a vault of the specified <vault_name>` |
| `/privatevaultsadd [<vault_name>] [<title>] [<size>]` | `Adds a new vault.` |
| `/privatevaultsremove [<vault_name>]` | `Removes a vault if it exisits.` |
| `/privatevaultsreset [<vault_name>]` | `Resets all inventory data of an exisiting vault. Can't be undone.`
